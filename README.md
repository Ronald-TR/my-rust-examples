This is a list of crates used by me to learn Rust.

## How to execute

You can use a dependency called `cargo-play`:

    cargo install cargo-play

And then, you can use it to execute single files instead of entire projects.

    cargo play src/pattern-match.rs -- 22 # passing 22 to the program as an argument.

    cargo play src/operators-overload.rs # or just executing some file.


This is a work-in-progress repo.
